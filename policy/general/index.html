<center><h2>General Policy</h2></center>
<center><h3>
These general policies cover the terms and conditions that are legally binding for Aquaridge Plumbing's audience, where “audience” refers to Aquaridge Plumbing's employees and clients. Every employee and client must confirm that they have read and agreed to these terms before the commencement of any project conducted by Aquaridge Plumbing. A confirmation may be in the form of a formal handwritten signature or an informal agreement, such as a text message with the utterance "Yes". However, these terms are only legally binding if the confirmation is explicitly related to these terms, known as the "General Policy". Confirmation of other terms does not render the policies below valid or legally binding.
